Essentially, you can make the most of your 13.6 inch mac display when you're out and about and automatically bring back the dock or apply other relevant settings when you're plugged in to monitors at work or home.",

DeskShift keeps your workflow smooth and uninterrupted, giving you more time to focus on what matters.
